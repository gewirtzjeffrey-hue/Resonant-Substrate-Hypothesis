Resonant Substrate Hypothesis (RSH) — Submission Text (v11.2)

The Resonant Substrate Hypothesis (RSH) proposes a measurable invariant linking the temporal decay of mutual information and spectral energy in dissipative systems:

    F = γ_MI / (2 γ_spec) ≈ 1

Derived from gravitational-wave strain data, this relation suggests a symmetry between informational and energetic dissipation, defining time as correlation decay. The hypothesis integrates empirical analysis, Bayesian inference, and thermodynamic reasoning in a reproducible, open-science framework.

This document serves as the short-form submission text associated with the v11.2 repository edition of RSH.

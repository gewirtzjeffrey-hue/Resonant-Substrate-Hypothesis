\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Resonant Substrate Hypothesis (RSH) establishes an empirical invariant that links the temporal decay of information and energy in dissipative systems. Using gravitational-wave data, we measure the mutual information decay constant ($\gamma_{MI}$) and spectral energy decay constant ($\gamma_{spec}$), finding their ratio $F = \gamma_{MI} / (2\gamma_{spec}) \approx 1$. This suggests a fundamental symmetry between informational and energetic dissipation rates, positioning RSH as a potential conservation framework that unites thermodynamic and informational principles.
\end{abstract}

\section{Mathematical Formulation}
Mutual Information Decay:
\[ I(\tau) = I_0 e^{-\gamma_{MI}\tau} \]
Spectral Energy Decay:
\[ E(\tau) = E_0 e^{-\gamma_{spec}\tau} \]
Invariant Definition:
\[ F = \frac{\gamma_{MI}}{2\gamma_{spec}} \approx 1 \]

\section{Discussion}
The observed constancy of $F$ across multiple gravitational-wave events implies a universal relationship between the rates of information loss and energy dissipation. This provides a measurable foundation for time as correlation decay.
